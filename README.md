# Web Application: Registration Form

This project is a web-based application that allows users to register using a simple form. The application saves user entries to local storage and displays them dynamically.

## Features

- **Responsive Registration Form**: Includes input fields for user details.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Stores user data in the browser's local storage.
- **Dynamic Table Rendering**: Displays user entries in a tabular format.
- **Stylish Design**: Utilizes inline CSS and Tailwind CSS for enhanced appearance.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: Contains the structure of the registration form and layout of the page.
- **`index.js`**: Implements the logic for handling form submissions, storing data in local storage, and dynamically displaying stored entries.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: To handle interactivity, local storage, and dynamic updates.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern, responsive styling.
- **Local Storage API**: To persist user data in the browser.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/registration-form.git
   cd registration-form
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the application.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**:
   - Fill out the form fields and submit.
   - The data is validated and stored in the browser's local storage.

2. **Data Display**:
   - Previously stored entries are dynamically displayed in a table below the form.
   - The table includes columns for user details such as name and email.

## Example

### Registration Form:
- Fields for user name, email, and other information.

### Data Display:
